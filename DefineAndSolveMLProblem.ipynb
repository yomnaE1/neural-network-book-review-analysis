Additionally, it can be informative to predict whether a book review is positive or negative because the author or publishers of a book can understand how to improve the storyline, grammar, etc. of a future book. Knowing which books have positive or negative reviews is also important because it can help determine which genre (romance, thriller, mystery) of books are trending with positive reviews, benefiting companies who make a profit from selling books to customers. Also knowing which genre of books is trenidng among consumers can be helpful for book authors or publishers to write books in the trending genere, and therefore, make a profit. Furthermore, this dataset would be useful to determine how well a publishing company is doing, compared to its competitors. If a competitor is doing better, than the publishing company can take steps to improve their books. "

    "Note: The final TfidfVectorizer arguments, neural network layers, and nerual network arugments that you will see in this notebook are the configurations that produced the best accuracy and loss scores for the training, validation, and test sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. I will not have a new feature list in the original dataframe \"df.\" I will also not be removing any columns from the dataset in the original dataframe. However, I will be using TF-IDF which transforms the features into numerical vectors, where each unique token (word) in the corpus represents a new feature. If I were to create a new dataframe that displayed the vectors into a TF-IDF matrix, then each column, or feature, would be a unique word in the vocabulary of the corpus and each row would be the document, or in this dataset, each product review. TF-IDF vectorization is used to determine how frequently a word (or token) appears in a document relative to a collection of documents. TF-IDF recognizes the words that are the most unique to a document and uses those unique words to represent the characteristics of that document. This way, TF-IDF can identify whether a review is positive or negative, based on specific words such as \"very good\" or \"very bad.\" Although I think the price of a book could also be useful in predicting whether a book review is positive or negative, it is not included in this dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. To perform the data preperation step, I will first check for missing feature values, in case there was an error in gathering the data or data processing. If there is a missing value, then I will either fill in the missing values with a string such as \"unavailable,\" as done with previous categorical variables, or would remove the example completely if they will not negatively affect the results produced by the machine learning model. Then, I will perform data cleaning and preprocessing by removing stop words, converting each word into lowercase letters, performing tokenization, and parsing text into meaningful groupings of words by producing n-grams, including both unigrams and bigrams. One reason why these preprocessing steps are important is because the goal of NLP, in general, is to reduce the size of the original text in its entirety because it can be high-dimensional and computationally expensive to process. Then, the next step is to convert the raw text into numerical representations for the machine learning model to understand. Thus, I would perform vectorization, more specifically TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) vectorization. TF-IDF calculates how frequently (or how relevant) a word (or token) is in a document relative to acollection of documents. After the data has been converted into TF-IDF vectors, then the next thing I will do is prepare for the data modeling phase of the machine learning cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The model that I will be using is a neural network. The reason why I want to use a neural network model is becuase they are good at solving complex problems such as NLP sentiment analysis. Rather than using a linear function such as logistic regression, which uses the sum of the features and their asscoiated weights to predict the label, neural networks use an activation function on all of the summations of the features multiplied by their weights to analyze non-linear relationships. A neural network is a good choice for modeling the dataset that I chose because it can handle large datasets with a large number of input features, which is beneficial for more complex weighted functions. Since the vocabulary of a TF-IDF contains a lot of tokens (words) neural networks, can handle this large amount of an input because each word in the corpus represents a feature value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. I will split the data into a training set and a test set, where 25% of the data will be a part of the test set. Then I will transform the features into numerical vectors using\n",
    "TfidfVectorizer. I will create a TfidfVectorizer object with the parameters stop_words='english'and ngram_range=(1, 2) to specify that I want to remove the stop words from a pre-defined list and include individual words plus a combination of two individual words (\"very bad\") into my feature list. The good news is that the default for lowercase is true and min_df is 1. Then, I will fit the vectorizer to the training data, and transform the training and test datasets into numerical vectors. After, I will create my neural network model with an input layer, three hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer will have an input shape (number of nodes) that corresponds to the vocabulary size of the corpus. The three hidden layers will have 64, 32, and 16 units nodes, respectively, and each layer will utilize the ReLU activation. However, the output layer will have 1 unit (node) and use the sigmoid activation function which maps the output to a probability between 0 and 1, since it is a binary classification problem. Then I will create a stochastic gradient descent optimizer with a learning rate of 0.1, create a binary cross entropy loss function, and will compile the model with the arguments of the stochastic gradient descent optimizer, loss function, and metric of accuracy to evaluate my model's performance. Then I will fit the neural network model to the training data by specifing the number of epochs, use 20% of the training to become the validation set, and use a custom logger function to output the loss and accuracy at the end of every 5 epochs. After fitting the model, I will print and display plots of the training and validation loss and accuracy every 5 epochs. After priniting and plotting the statistics, I will evaluate the model's performance by investigating the training and validation loss and accuracies to see if they show signs of overfitting or underfitting. Based on the data, I will decide whether I want to add Keras Dropout regularization layers after one or all hidden layers, or tweak the number of epochs to improve model's performance. Then, I will determine which num_epochs and Dropout layers cofigurations results in the lowest overfitting but produces the highest validation and training accuracy, as well as the lowest training and validation loss. After figuring out the best loss and accuracy scores by adding Dropout layers or changing the number of epochs, I will evaluate the model's performance on the test set. I will evaluate the accuracy and loss for the test set and examine a few examples (reviews) to see if the predictions my model made match the actual label. I will then experiment with the settings of the neural network and vectorizer to see if I need to change min_df, the learning rate, or add more layers to the neural network. By adjusting the settings of the TF-IDF vectorizer and neural network, I can determine which method produces the highest test accuracy, training accuracy, and validation accuracy without overfitting the data too much. I will also determine the TF-IDF vectorizer and neural network configurations that produce the lowest training, validation, and test loss, as well as find the settings that reduce the elapsed time. The final TfidfVectorizer arguments, neural network layers, and nerual network arugments that you will see in this notebook are the configurations that produced the best accuracy and loss scores for the training, validation, and test sets.

      "I have read Baldacci's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them.  This one, however, is just awful.  Not only the character's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie.  The only thing I can think of to compare it to is this :  There was a series of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons where Calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows, with lame lines like \"The gun was loaded, and so was I\".  That is exactly what this book is like, except it goes on for 400 pages.  There isn't a single interesting character in this book, in my opinion.  You just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end.  It's the Bataan Death March of novels.  I hope this is an aberration - I'll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that I read were so good.
